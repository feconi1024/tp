### Project: NUSConnect

NUSConnect - It helps NUS students efficiently organise and manage the contact details of peers they meet during
tutorials and group projects. It is designed for users who prefer a CLI. It allows for custom labeling, reminders, easy 
updates, and is optimised for building and maintaining academic connections throughout their university journey.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java.
